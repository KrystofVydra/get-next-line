This file was created by the KOSTAL project wizard and explains how to use the created project structure.
For a detailed explanation, see Help - Help Contents - KOSTAL Distribution Documentation - General Setup and Updates - Project Setup.
You may safely delete this file if you are familiar with the structure.

The Eclipse project 'get-next-line_C' should be used to store C source code:
 * Folder 'Source' contains all source files (c- and h-files) which will be indexed by the C indexer
 * Folder 'Target' is the target folder as configured in the makefiles
 * Folder 'Tools' contains makefiles, scripts, and configurations for Doxygen, Tessy, and QAC

If you are working on other parts, you may safely close this project and re-open it again, when you need it.
This may save memory and performance because artifacts contained in closed projects are not loaded.
